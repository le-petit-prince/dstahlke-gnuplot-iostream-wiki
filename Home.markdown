## gnuplot-iostream

This interface allows gnuplot to be controlled from C++ and is designed to be the lowest hanging fruit. In other words, if you know how gnuplot works it should only take 30 seconds to learn this library. Basically it is just an iostream pipe to gnuplot with some extra functions for pushing data arrays (STL or blitz++) and getting mouse clicks.
